# Stroke-Extraction
This is a simple python implementation of [From Paper to Machine: Extracting Strokes from Images for use in Sketch Recognition](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/hammond/publications/pdf/2008RajanSBIM.pdf) by Pankaj Rajan and Tracy Hammond

I used this implementation in my thesis that deals with offline parsing of sketched business process models.
