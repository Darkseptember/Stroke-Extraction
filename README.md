# Stroke-Extraction
This is a simple python implementation of [From Paper to Machine: Extracting Strokes from Images for use in Sketch Recognition](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/hammond/publications/pdf/2008RajanSBIM.pdf) by Pankaj Rajan and Tracy Hammond. 

I modified the original implementation at some points to adopt it to my specific needs.
